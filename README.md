# GO-examples
Some Golang tested examples 
The Sample Program for a simple linked-list in GO. The link-list provides the following APIs.
1: insert a new Node -- The node is added to the tail.
2: search a node     -- Iterate over the list and do linear search, return true if found.
3: delete a node     -- It searches a the node to be deletes and then delete the node.
4: reverse the list  -- It reverses the link list (E.g A->B->C->D gets reversed to D->C->B->A) using while loop.
5: reverse the list  -- It uses recusrsive calls to reserve the list.
6: print the list    -- It goes to each node linearly from hear to tail and print outs the data(string) of each node.
